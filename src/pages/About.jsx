          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Selassie Ethiopian Orthodox Church in London was founded to serve
            the growing Ethiopian community and all who wish to worship in the
            ancient Orthodox tradition. Over the years, the parish has become a
            spiritual home for families, students, and visitors from many
            backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our services follow the Ethiopian Orthodox rite, with hymns, icons,
            incense, and the rich liturgical life of the Church.

          <h3>What We Believe</h3>
          <p>
            We uphold the faith of the one holy, universal, and apostolic Church
            as handed down through the Apostles and the Fathers. Our worship is
            centred on the Divine Liturgy, the sacraments, and daily prayer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to live out the Gospel through love, hospitality, and
            service to those in need.
