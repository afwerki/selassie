      longDescription: `
Debre Genet Holy Trinity Church is a parish of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church—one of the world’s most ancient Christian traditions, with roots extending to early Judaic practice and the earliest centuries of Christianity.

Established in London in 2006, the Church has been dedicated to proclaiming the message of Christ through worship, pastoral care, education, and service to the wider community.

The Church provides regular liturgical services, counselling and guidance to families and vulnerable young adults, and pastoral visits to the sick, housebound, and elderly. It also plays an active role in youth development and community outreach, ensuring faith is lived through compassion, responsibility, and service.

## Condition of the Building and Need for Restoration

Prior to acquisition, the building had suffered from long-term structural deterioration. Years of foundation movement resulted in cracking to stone walls, piers, arches, and window mullions. There is also significant evidence of water ingress through the roofs, parapet gutters, and stonework.

Temporary internal and external steel support structures were installed decades ago to stabilise cracked stone pillars on the front elevation.

A **Building Survey Report (February 2019)** identified a number of urgent repairs necessary to stabilise and regenerate the building. In **May 2019**, **Historic England** assessed the church as **“Heritage at Risk”**, formally recognising its vulnerable condition.

**Historic England Listing:**  
https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/heritage-at-risk/search-register/list-entry/19550

Without comprehensive restoration, the condition of the building—and the vital spiritual, cultural, and community activities it supports—will continue to deteriorate.

---

## Scope of the Restoration Project

The proposed restoration project aims to return the building to a good state of repair, remove temporary stabilisation measures, and ensure its long-term future as a place of worship and community use.

### Principal Works

1. **Roof Restoration**
   - Restoration of the main and subsidiary roofs
   - Replacement of flat roof and built-up felt coverings
   - Renewal of roof decks and installation of insulation
   - Chemical treatment of exposed timbers
   - Repair or replacement of rainwater goods

2. **Stonework Conservation**
   - Assessment and repair of structural cracks in walls, piers, and arches
   - Restoration of eroded stonework
   - Repair of defective mortar joints
   - Overhaul of chimneys

3. **Structural and Architectural Repairs**
   - Repair of front elevation window mullions and the baptistery arch
   - Safe removal of long-standing temporary steel support frames
   - Necessary underpinning works to the front and rear elevations

---

## Community and Public Benefit

On completion, the restored building will provide a safe, stable, and welcoming environment for worship, reflection, celebration, mourning, and community gathering.

The project will particularly benefit:
- Elderly and housebound individuals
- Vulnerable adults and families
- Children and young people receiving guidance and support

The restoration will also improve the appearance and safety of the surrounding environment, contributing positively to the wellbeing of the wider neighbourhood.

The building’s renewal will support the Church’s wider social mission, including **the Friday Kitchen**, which has provided approximately **350 hot meals every week** to homeless and vulnerable individuals for almost five years.

---

## A Shared Responsibility

For centuries, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has preserved faith, worship, music, and learning across generations.

Today, we share a responsibility to safeguard the physical space that enables this living heritage to continue in the United Kingdom.

This restoration is not simply about repairing a historic structure—it is about preserving **faith, identity, culture, and service** for present and future generations.

---
